priority: min-width/max-width > flex-basis > width > content width

flex: 1; means 1 grow, 1 shrink, 0 flex-basis (grow to max-width, shrink to min-width, so flex-basis is practically ignored, so this is most commonly used)

default: flex-grow:0 , flex-shrink:1;

flex-basis: auto; more space for items with more content and vice-versa. (so flex-basise: 0 means equal width as we switched it off)

Solution:

/* Write your CSS code below to make the blue items size, grow and shrink like the green ones.*/

.container {
  justify-content: space-between;
}
  
.container > * {

}

.item1 {
  flex-basis: 200px;
}

.item2 {
  flex-basis: 200px;
  flex-shrink: 0;
}

.item3 {
  flex-basis: 400px;
  flex-shrink: 0;
}
